OAuth Authentication for Zikula 1.4.3+

Setting up the providers
========================

Each provider (or authentication method) requires you to set up an 'application' for each website that employs this module.
Typically you create the application at their website and are provided with a `clientId` and a `clientSecret`.
In order to function, this module must have those two strings entered in the settings for each method.

Further instructions for setting up each provider is on the settings page for that provider.
